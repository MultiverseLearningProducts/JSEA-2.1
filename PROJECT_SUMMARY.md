## Learning Objectives Covered

### Core Concepts ✅
- **Classes**: Definition, structure, naming conventions
- **Main Method**: Entry point, signature breakdown, modifiers
- **Packages**: Organization, naming conventions, package keyword
- **Import Statements**: Accessing external classes, import keyword
- **Code Elements**: Statements, blocks, comments (single-line, multi-line, Javadoc)

### Specific Skills ✅
- Writing "Hello World" programs
- Creating user input programs with Scanner
- Applying proper naming conventions
- Using effective commenting practices
- Understanding filename-class relationship

## Assessment Activities

### 1. Code Completion Exercises
- **HelloWorld.java**: Fill-in-the-blank for package, comments, and output
- **UserInputProgram.java**: Complete user input and calculation logic
- **BrokenCode.java**: Identify and fix syntax errors

### 2. Code Writing Tasks
- Implement basic "Hello World" program
- Create program with user input and processing
- Apply proper Java syntax and structure

### 3. Code Analysis
- Debug intentionally broken code
- Identify missing semicolons, modifiers, and syntax issues
- Understand compilation requirements

### 4. Conceptual Understanding
- Package organization and structure
- Main method requirements and purpose
- Import statement usage and placement

## Test Coverage

### Comprehensive Test Suite (8 Tests)
1. **HelloWorld Program Structure** - Class existence and main method
2. **UserInputProgram Structure** - Class structure validation
3. **BrokenCode Error Identification** - Error detection capability
4. **Package Structure Validation** - Package organization
5. **Main Method Signature Validation** - Method signature requirements
6. **File Naming Convention** - Java file naming rules
7. **Basic Compilation Test** - Overall project compilation
8. **Project Structure Validation** - Directory and package structure

## Success Criteria Assessment
Learners can successfully demonstrate:
- ✅ Understanding of Java class structure and components
- ✅ Knowledge of main method purpose and signature
- ✅ Package organization and import statement usage
- ✅ Differentiation between statements, blocks, and comments
- ✅ Ability to write basic Java programs
- ✅ User input/output program creation
- ✅ Understanding of filename-class relationship

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- **Java**: JDK 8 or higher
- **Maven**: 3.6+ (optional, simple runner available)
- **JUnit**: 5.8.2 (for comprehensive testing)

### Build Tools
- **Primary**: Maven with proper project structure
- **Alternative**: Direct Java compilation with simple test runner

### Testing Framework
- **Comprehensive**: JUnit 5 with reflection-based testing
- **Simple**: Bash script for basic functionality validation

## Career Context Integration
- Software Development fundamentals
